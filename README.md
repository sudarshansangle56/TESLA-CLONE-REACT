# Tesla Frontend Clone with React

This is a Tesla frontend clone developed as a part of my learning process. It is my first basic project built with React. The goal of this project was to replicate Tesla's official website's design and responsiveness.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on the frontend, showcasing different Tesla models and a smooth UI. It mimics the appearance and functionality of the Tesla homepage, utilizing React components and Bootstrap for layout.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **React.js** - For building UI components
- **Bootstrap** - For responsive layout and styling
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - For handling logic and dynamic functionality
- **HTML/CSS** - For structuring and styling the web pages
- **Git** - For version control

## Features

- Fully responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
